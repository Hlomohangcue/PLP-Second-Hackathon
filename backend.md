1. Backend Foundation (Flask)
The System_Design.md specifies a Python Flask server. This will act as the bridge between the frontend, the AI API, and the database.

Task: Create a backend/ directory in the root of your project.

Action: Inside this directory, initialize a Flask application. You'll need to set up the basic server structure and configure it to handle API requests. The Developer_tasks.md suggests using SQLAlchemy for database models, so you should also install and set that up.

2. Database Integration
The System_Design.md and Developer_tasks.md both highlight the need for persistent storage using MySQL.

Task: Define the database schema. According to the documents, you need tables for users, flashcards, and sessions. For the MVP, the user and session tables can be simple placeholders as the User_management.md specifies a session-based approach without user accounts. The most important table is flashcards, which should store the questions and answers.

Action: Create a migration script to set up the MySQL database. Within your Flask app, use SQLAlchemy to define the Flashcard model. This model will map to your flashcards table and allow you to easily save the AI-generated content.

3. AI Service Implementation
This is the core of your "AI Study Buddy." As per the System_Design.md, you will use the Hugging Face API.

Task: Create a dedicated service or module in your backend to handle all AI-related logic.

Action: This module will contain a function that takes the user's notes as input, sends a request to the Hugging Face API, and processes the response. The Requirements_Specification.md states that the system should generate exactly 5 questions from the notes, so your code should be designed to handle this specific output.

4. API Endpoint Creation
The frontend needs to communicate with the backend to generate flashcards. A RESTful API endpoint is required for this.

Task: Create a route in your Flask application, such as /api/process-notes, to handle the note submission.

Action: This endpoint should perform a series of steps:

Receive the user's study notes from the frontend via a POST request.

Pass these notes to your AI service function.

Receive the generated questions and answers from the AI service.

Save the flashcard data to your MySQL database using the SQLAlchemy model.

Return the generated flashcards as a JSON response to the frontend.

5. Frontend-Backend Integration
With the backend ready, you need to connect the UI you've already built to the new API.

Task: Modify the main.js file to replace the placeholder fetch call with a real API request to your new endpoint.

Action: Update the generateBtn event listener in main.js to send the notes-input value to the /api/process-notes endpoint. The frontend should then take the JSON response and use it to dynamically render the interactive flashcards. This ensures the entire system works as a single, cohesive application.
