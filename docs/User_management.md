### 2.3 User Session Management

#### Session-Based Approach (MVP)
For the hackathon MVP, we'll use simple session-based user management:

**Session Creation**
- Automatic session creation on first visit
- Session ID stored in browser cookie/localStorage
- Session expires after 30 days of inactivity
- No user registration required

**Session Data Storage**
```javascript
// Session Structure
{
  sessionId: "unique-session-identifier",
  createdAt: "2024-timestamp",
  lastActive: "2024-timestamp",
  flashcardSets: [
    {
      id: "set-id-1",
      title: "Biology Chapter 5",
      createdAt: "timestamp",
      cardCount: 5,
      lastStudied: "timestamp"
    }
  ]
}
```
